"""Celery application — Redis broker + result backend.

``acks_late`` + ``prefetch_multiplier=1`` give graceful backpressure: a worker
takes exactly one heavy file at a time and only acks it once done, so a crash
re-queues the file instead of losing it. Scale throughput by running more worker
processes/containers.
